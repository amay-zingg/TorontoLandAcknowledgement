            <h1>Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt</h1>
            <p>Treaty 13 Territory</p>
            <p>Toronto is in the “Dish With One Spoon Territory.” The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between
                the Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee that bound them to share the territory and protect the land.
                Subsequent
                Indigenous Nations and peoples, Europeans and all newcomers, have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of
                peace,
                friendship and respect.</p>
            <p>The “Dish” or sometimes it is called the “Bowl” represents what is now southern Ontario (from the Great Lakes to
                Quebec
                and from Lake Simcoe into the U.S.). * We all eat out of the Dish – all of us that share this territory – with only
                one
                spoon. That means we have to share the responsibility of ensuring the dish is never empty; which includes, taking
                care
                of the land and the creatures we share it with. Importantly, there are no knives at the table, representing that we
                must
                keep the peace.</p>

                            <p>“‘Mississauga’ is a colonial word,” she says. “Ojibway, Chippewa – it’s what the Dutch, the
                            British, or the French
                            called us. We’re Anishnabe.” That word translates as “human beings.”</p>
                            <p>Tkaronto = Mohawk word meaning “where there are trees standing in the water”</p>

                                        More than 13,000 years ago, Davenport Road followed the same line of the bluffs that formed the shoreline of mighty Lake
                                        Iroquois. The trail extended all the way west to Hamilton harbour and east to Kingston. Evidence of settlements along
                                        the route date back some 11,000 years when nomads fished and hunted caribou, mastodon and mammoth.
                                        
                                        In colonial times, the trail provided a link to the major trading routes of the Humber, Don and Rouge. The Toronto
                                        Islands provided a resting place and safe harbour for weary travellers and traders. Casa Loma at the top of Spadina sits
                                        on a former Mississauga council ground. Spadina comes from the Anishnabe term “Ishpaadina,” meaning “the clump of land
                                        you see out there,” a reference to the Toronto Islands, which are visible from here.
                                        
                                        The lands around the lake were home of five founding nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Mohawks, Oneidas,
                                        Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas), who would later move into the Toronto area during the 17th century.
                                        
                                        But the construction of Fort York in 1793, which created a permanent military base in Tkaronto (then York), would make
                                        it a focus of economic activity in the area – and later – a flashpoint for war in 1812.
                                        
                                        Conventional wisdom is that colonists dominated the area. But there were barely 700 inhabitants in York. The Senecas,
                                        who controlled the trade routes along the Humber and Rouge, were being replaced in the region by Algonkian speakers from
                                        central Ontario, who would dominate the history of the region to the end of the 18th century.
                                        
                                        But the Algonkian Mississaugas, as they would come to be known, did little farming. Instead, they were hunter-gatherers,
                                        living in seasonal settlements, and catching salmon. A huge wave of British immigration following the American
                                        Revolutionary War would soon follow and change everything.</p>
